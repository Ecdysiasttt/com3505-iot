Hello Harry Scutt!

My records state that you're not in a pair.

(If this is incorrect please get in touch!)

We've reviewed your COM3505 assessment 1 from
https://gitlab.com/hasscutt1/com3505-student-2024

Congratulations, you've passed!

As you know, we don't provide marks for this part of the course
assessment, but if we _were_ doing so, we would estimate your work to
be somewhere in the 1st quartile.

That's excellent work, well done!

Some feedback:

Excellent work, well done!

Your project submission for the IoT device focusing on network
provisioning and over-the-air updates is comprehensive and
well-structured. You've effectively utilized the ESP32's capabilities
to demonstrate both the provisioning process and how OTA updates can
be managed, aligning well with the assignment's rubric.

From your documentation, it's evident that you've put significant
effort into detailing each stage of operation with corresponding LED
indicators, which is crucial for understanding the state of the device
without needing a serial monitor. This approach is particularly useful
in real-world applications where immediate visual feedback is
necessary. The choice of using different colors to indicate various
states (yellow for processing, green for success, and red for critical
updates) is a thoughtful touch enhancing the user interaction
experience.

The hardware setup section is well-documented with clear images and
descriptions of the breadboard configuration, which meets the rubric's
requirements for hardware documentation. Moreover, the addition of a
video link demonstrating the functionality is a commendable way to
provide a real-time illustration of how the device performs, which
supports both technical and operational documentation criteria.

Your firmware implementation is robust, with a clear separation of
concerns shown by the division of code into different functions and
modules. The use of a web server for network configuration and the
handling of OTA updates through HTTP requests are well-executed.

However, ensuring that you handle potential errors more
comprehensively during the OTA update process could make the system
more resilient, such as more detailed handling when the .bin file
retrieval fails or when the update size is improbable.

Lastly, the testing section demonstrates a thorough approach to
ensuring reliability and functionality under different scenarios,
which is crucial for IoT devices. This not only shows your
understanding of the system but also your ability to foresee and
mitigate practical issues that might arise.

Overall, your project meets the rubric's requirements effectively with
comprehensive documentation, a clear demonstration of technical
capabilities, and thoughtful testing and presentation. Great job on
creating a demonstrative IoT device that clearly aligns with the
educational goals of the course.
